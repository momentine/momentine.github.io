## about me

I am an incoming computer science master's student at Brown University. I am interested in creating designs that improve user experience, accessibility, and mental health within human-computer interaction.

I recently received my B.S. from Arizona State University, where I double majored in computer science and psychology. 

## about my mentor

My mentor is [Jeff Huang](https://jeffhuang.com/), an associate professor in computer science at Brown University, with a Ph.D. from the University of Washington. His work involves decoding users' behavioral data to drive novel applications. His research areas span human-computer interaction and information retrieval, across the domains of mobile devices, self-tracking, games, and web search.


## about my project

My project is on messaging interfaces, specifically on how different typing visibility designs influence user perceptions of collaborative problem solving within digital communication. My study aims to test four different typing indicators: no indicator interface (see the other person’s message after it has been sent), typing indicator interface (see the other person is typing through three animated dots “...” or through“Person X is typing”), character indicator interface (see the other person is typing through characters replaced with “#” before the message is sent), and live typing interface (see everything the other is typing including backspacing as the message is being written or in other words, before it is sent) to 
examine the role of each text-visibility mode and understand if live typing can be leveraged as a strategic tool for problem solving in text-based communication.
