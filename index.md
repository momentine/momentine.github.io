## about me

I am an incoming computer science master's student at Brown University. I am interested in creating designs that improve user experience, accessibility, and mental health within human-computer interaction.

I recently received my B.S. from Arizona State University, where I double majored in computer science and psychology. 

## about my mentor

My mentor is [Jeff Huang](https://jeffhuang.com/), an associate professor in computer science at Brown University, with a Ph.D. from the University of Washington. His work involves decoding users' behavioral data to drive novel applications. His research areas span human-computer interaction and information retrieval, across the domains of mobile devices, self-tracking, games, and web search.


## about my project

This collaborative project is on messaging interfaces, specifically on how different levels of typing visibility influence user's perceived workload, reflections and experiences.
