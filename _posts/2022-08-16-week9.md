# Participants 
***

To-Do List

Organize participants list and assign UUIDs
continue breakout rooms
Understand database behind code
Discuss interface ordering and participant shuffling
draft emails for selected/not selected/ waitlisted people from survey
Task Updates

[complete] breakout rooms figured out but been slow on it and much of the code has further progressed (need to work on technical skills)
[complete] Listed participants and email on excel sheet
Noticed that IP address from eligibility survey did not match with residing in the US (asked in cheeseburger)
[maybe] Redo flier and email
Two follow up questions are needed: "what is your ethnicity?" and "what language do you prefer when messaging?"
[complete] emails drafted
