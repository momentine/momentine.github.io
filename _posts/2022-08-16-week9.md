# Participants 
***

To-Do List

This week, we organized chat room IDs and participant IDs on excel. I got to understand the basics of the backend and how keystroke level data will be stored in DBeaver. We also came up with a balanced latin square to organize the participants so that there will be no redundant chat interaction between two particpants. I learned a lot about how to recruit remote participants and the obstacles that come along with that.
