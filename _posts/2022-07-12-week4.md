# Methodology
***
My mentor gave me lots of comments on my 50 measuralbes list. He recommended that it was time to narrow them down. My graduate student mentor suggested I look into NASA TLX as one of the evaluation/assesment methods because it can measure multiple factors. I ultimately decided on a title for the paper and two research questions for the study. I also chose to focus on problem solving as the measurable while using NASA TLX inspired surveys and semi-structured interviews as the measures. This week gave me a lot of insight on how different qualitative and quantitative study designs work.
