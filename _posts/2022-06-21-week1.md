# First Impressions of Brown University's HCI Reserch Lab

I met my mentor and some of the other REU and PhD students at the HCI lab. Everyone was so friendly. There, my mentor introduced me to [cheeseburger](https://cheeseburgertherapy.org/), a digital cognitive therapy chat website that has a feature called the character or masked indicator. This indicator shows the other person's texts in the form of #s as they type. The concept was espically intriguing to me, and we utlimately decided to conduct a research study with different types of indicators to see how they would effect communication for my DREU program. For my first few tasks, I was assigned to find 5 clossest papers to SMS/DM style texting (texting indicators, show hidden characters while typing, full live typing) and to contact the PhD student whom I will be working with.
