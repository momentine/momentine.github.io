# First Impressions of Brown University's HCI Reserch Lab

I met my mentor and some of the other REU and Ph.D students at the HCI lab. Everyone was so friendly. There, my mentor introduced me to [cheeseburger](https://cheeseburgertherapy.org/), a digital cognitive therapy chat website that has a feature called the character or masked indicator. This indicator shows the other person's texts in the form of #s as they type. My mentor was thinking what if there was another interface that kind of worked like google docs where one can see the other person’s message as they are typing (backspace and all). The concept was especially intriguing to me, and we utlimately decided to conduct a research study with different types of indicators to see how they would effect communication for my DREU program. For my first few tasks, I was assigned to find 5 clossest papers to SMS/DM style texting (texting indicators, show hidden characters while typing, full live typing) and to contact Zainab, the Ph.D student whom I will be working with on this project.
