# Final Paper   
***
Finally finishing up the paper! This paper was a collaborative effort among me, Z.I. and Professor Huang and would not have been possible without them. I struggled the most with analyzing the qualitative data in the results section as it was my first time doing so. Z.I. described qualitative analysis to be and gave me a paper to read on how the section shouldbe written. Overall, I am truly grateful for this opportunity and Z.I. and Professor Huang's continuous support. The experience showed me what computing research is like and helped me define my strenghts and weaknesses in the feild.
