# Final Paper   
***
Finally finishing up the project! This week, I struggled the most with analyzing the qualitative data in the results section as it was my first time doing so. Z.I. described qualitative analysis is like mastering a type of art and gave me a paper to read on how the section shouldbe written which helped quite a bit with the writing. 

Overall, I am incredibly grateful for my DREU oppportunity and so thankful for Z.I. and Professor Huang's continuous support throughout the process. The experience showed me what computing research is like and helped me define my strenghts and weaknesses in this feild.
