# Study Design Ideas
***

I have completed my list of 50 candidate measureables and am in the process of foramtting them into research questions. I am getting a lot of helpful feedback from the other PhD students. I am also trying to connect past research designs and methods to my current study. Zainab and I are thinking of ways to imitate different typing indicators (e.g. Google sheets/docs, paper and pencil, modifying cheeseburger code, other web chat coding tools) for the study. Progress felt slow this week but Zainab reasurred me that it is normal in research.
