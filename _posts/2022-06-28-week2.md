# Brainstorming
***

My office space is set up. I had my first meeting with Z.I., the Ph.D student mentor, through Zoom and we decided to meet twice a week. My mentor encouraged me to come up with a list of 50 candidate measureables for the study. He suggested I also look at papers that are referenced by or references last week's papers I found. Zainab also shared some papers with me that addresses the problems and gaps in texting. So far, we are leaning towards a within subjects design that evaluates four different types of indicator interfaces. There was a lot of reading this week. I am starting to realize that the research surrounding typing/text visiblity is extremely limited and need to be more clever with my phrasing when looking for related work.
