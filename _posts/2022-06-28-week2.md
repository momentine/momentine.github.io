# Brainstorming
***

My office space is set up and I had my first meeting with Zainab. My mentor encouraged me to come up with a list of 50 candidate measureables for the study. He suggested I also look at papers that are referenced by or references last week's papers I found. Zainab also shared some papers with me that addresses the problems and gaps in texting. So far, we are leaning towards a within subjects design that evaluates four different types of indicator interfaces. Lots of reading this week. I am starting to realize that there is such few past research on typing/text visiblity and need to be more clever with my phrasing when looking for related work.
