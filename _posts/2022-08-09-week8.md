# Recruitment 
***

The fliers have been launched and there were over 100+ responses from the eligibility survey. I have also been working on implementing breakout rooms for the interfaces but have been struggling to get each room to resemble a different indicator since I am not too familiar with JavaScript. This week I realized that technical skills are just as important forr CS research and that I will probably need to work on them first before pursuing other research projects.
