# Recruitment 
***
To-Do List

Finalize methods section of paper (including recruitment section)
Start launching flier and recruiting participants (have gotten over 60+ responses!)
Add break out rooms to web chat code
Task Updates

[ongoing] methods section draft is complete but needs lots of editing
[needs to be worked on] recruitment section too passive
[ongoing] breakout rooms stuck on getting indicators to work
[complete] launched flier onto Reddit, Facebook, Twitter, and Instagram
Lots of tasks ongoing because I was not feeling too well. Hopefully will catch up next week.
