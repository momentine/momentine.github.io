# Human Subjects Research or Program Evaluation 

My graudate student mentor and I have been working on a long and tedious IRB application. We scheduled a meeting with Brown's IRB department for next weeek as we think our current study falls in the gray area between human subjects research and program evaluation. My mentor commented that Brown has had studies that were more on the program evaluation side than this, and IRB determined it was not human subjects but they have also had studies that were a bit more human-focused than this, and IRB considered it exempt. This was an interesting way to check where IRB would lean on for studies like ours. I have also given a lot of thought to what problem solving prompts could be used for the study. At first, I thought of river crossing problems but my mentor quickly rejected the idea as he did not see anything collaborative about it. He noted that maybe a teaching task or one that involved team building could be better. This made me think that maybe an open ended decsion makiing problem might be better than the tactical ones I initially came up with.
