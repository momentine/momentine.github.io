# Human Subjects Research or Program Evaluation 

My graudate student mentor and I have been working on a long and tedious IRB application. We scheduled a meeting with Brown's IRB department for next weeek as we think our current study falls in the gray area between human subjects research and program evaluation. My mentor commented that Brown has had studies that were more on the program evaluation side than this, and IRB determined it was not human subjects but they have also had studies that were a bit more human-focused than this, and IRB considered it exempt. This was an interesting way to check where IRB would lean on for studies like ours. 

Further, my graduate student mentor and I have decided to code the web chat application using JavaScript with node.js and socket.io
