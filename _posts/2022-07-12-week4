# Methodology

I started a methods section 


Start methods section outline
Look into IRB process
Look into nasa tlx questions
Narrow down measures
Solidify research question and measures
Think of ways to carry out study and recruit participants
Task Updates

Web socket may be better option
[ongoing] - add to/modify nasa tlx questions
[ongoing] - design flier (recruit participants randomly rather than just Brown University students)
Potential Study Design:

Title: Evaluating the Role of Text Visibility in Digital Communication for Problem Solving

Research question:

What is the role of text-visibility in digital communication?

Can live typing be leveraged as a strategic tool for problem solving in digital communication?

live typing will improve problem solving
Within subjects

24 participants -> split into groups of 2 -> each group will start with regular interface solving a problem, then each group will switch to live typing with a different problem (same difficulty level)

Qualitative data (modified nasa tlx) collected after each interface

mental demand
physical demand
temporal demand
performance
effort
frustration
anxiety
Quantitative data (semi-structured interview) at the end

thoughts, feelings, behavior
