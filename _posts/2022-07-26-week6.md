# Problem Solving Tasks 
***
I have also given a lot of thought to what problem solving prompts could be used for the study. At first, I thought of river crossing problems but my mentor quickly rejected the idea as he did not see anything collaborative about it. He noted that I should think about teaching tasks or one that involved team building. This made me think that maybe an open ended decsion makiing problem like survival problems might be better than the tactical ones I initially came up with. The draft of the recruitment flier has also been finished. Further, IRB determined our study to fall under program evaluation which is great news for us.
