# Testing Interfaces
***
During my meeting with Zainab, we tested out all the interfaces with different problem solving tasks. We found that survival scenario problems allowed most room for conversations and disagreements. The recruitment flyer and elgibility survey has been finalized. We have decided that our study will be remote to ensure diversity. We have been looking at ways to recruit participants online through Facebook groups, personal newsfeed, Reddit, and Prolific. Through Zainab's help, the front end of the web chat application is now working with the different interface types.
