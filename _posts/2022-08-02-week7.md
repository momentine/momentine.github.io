# Testing Interfaces
***
During my meeting with Zainab, we tested out all the interfaces with different problem solving tasks. We found that survival scenario problems allowed most room for conversations and disagreements. The recruitment flyer and elgibility survey has been finalized. Since our study will be remote, we have been looking at ways to recruit participants online through Facebook groups, personal newsfeed, Reddit, and Prolific. Trough Zainab's help, the front end of the web chat application is now working with the different interface types as well
